This color scheme is for those who likes dark (but not black) background. 
The colors are nice and natural and will not make your eyes burn.
Put some jungle in your code with these green-red-orange gradations.

The color scheme is suitable for using on 16 color terminals.

Initial inspiration for two primary colors came from divxstation.com.
